## Pain vs. Suffering

that was talking about the pain which will give us more power to be able to challenge our self to take benefet from this  pain , 
It’s not easy, nor is it common. This is why the skilled people are highly-valued in the software development industry.
we are building our value. 
we are experiencing the pain of growth.
for the future to become full-stack software developer capable of meeting all challenges with a clear head and strong heart.


## A beginner's guide to Big O Notation
means , describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm 
**describes** : the worst-case scenario,
 the execution time required or the space used
 
 Types :
 
 O(1) : an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set
 
 O(N) :  describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.
 
 O(N²) : represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.
 
 O(2^N) : denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set.
 
 O(log N) : The iterative halving of data sets described in the binary search example produces a growth curve that peaks at the beginning and slowly flattens out as the size of the data sets increase
