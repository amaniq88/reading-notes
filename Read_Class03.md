## Reading and Writing Files in Python
### What Is a File?
a file is a contiguous set of bytes used to store data ( which can be as simple as a text file or as complicated as a program executable)
**File parts**
- Header: metadata about the contents of the file (file name, size, type, and so on)

- Data: contents of the file as written by the creator or editor

- End of file (EOF): special character that indicates the end of the file

**File Paths**
The file path is a string that represents the location of a file (Folder Path  / File Name / Extension )

**Line Endings**
how to representation of a new line or line ending.
Windows uses the CR+LF characters to indicate a new line, while Unix and the newer Mac versions use just the LF character

**Character Encodings**
An encoding is a translation from byte data to human readable characters.
This is typically done by assigning a numerical value to represent a character.
The two most common encodings are the ASCII and UNICODE Formats.

## Opening and Closing a File in Python
to work with file steps :
1- open the file .open() with modes ( r / w / rb / wb ) 
2- to make sure the file will be closed even if the user forget or error ocured we use the command try-finally or with statement

**file objects**
file object is  an object exposing a file-oriented API (with methods such as read() or write()) to an underlying resource.
types:
- Text files , open() will return a TextIOWrapper file object
- Buffered binary files , open() will return either a BufferedReader or BufferedWriter file object.
- Raw binary files , open() will return a FileIO file object

### Writing on file 
.write(string)	This writes the string to the file.

.writelines(seq)	This writes the sequence to the file. No line endings are appended to each sequence item. 
It’s up to you to add the appropriate line ending(s).



## Python Exceptions: An Introduction
### Exceptions versus Syntax Errors
Syntax errors occur when the parser detects an incorrect statement
exception error occurs whenever syntactically correct Python code results in an error.

**Raising an Exception**
If you want to throw an error when a certain condition occurs using raise .

**The AssertionError Exception**
Instead of waiting for a program to crash midway, you can also start by making an assertion in Python. 

**The try and except Block: Handling Exceptions**
The try and except block in Python is used to catch and handle exceptions. 
Python executes code following the try statement as a “normal” part of the program. 

**The else Clause**
using the else statement, you can instruct a program to execute a certain block of code only in the absence of exceptions.

**Cleaning Up After Using finally**
everything in the finally clause will be executed. It does not matter if you encounter an exception somewhere in the try or else clauses.
